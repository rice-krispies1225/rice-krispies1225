i like deltarune, undertale, the amazing digital circus, splatoon, stardew valley, kirby, and mario. there is way more but i cannot be bothered to list them all, just know that those are the main things

if my status in pony town is looking for chat, that means i'm mostly active and anyone can come talk to me, would prefer if you whispered but you don't really have to
if my status in pony town is looking for roleplay, that means i'm open to being asked to roleplay
if my status in pony town is idle, that means i'm VERY afk. you can still whisper or cuddle freely but it might take me a minute or two to respond
if my status in pony town is busy (which it very often isn't) that means i kinda just want some space, so i might not want to interact

for folks who have found me through the undertale/deltarune area:
im not a big fan of ships, but i do like suselle. i'm fine if you cuddle with me as any character, as i will not see it as a ship, but please ask if you want to be romantic or roleplay
speaking of roleplaying, i'm fine with it, as long as it's not completely out of the blue. im fine with you acting in character to me, but if you want to do a more serious and detailed RP ask first
and yeah, that's about it. anyone can interact with me

for folks who have found me through the TADC area:
i also do not like any ships really. so yeah, basically the same with the undertale/deltarune area. also since the area is so crowded most of the time i might get a bit overwhelmed and not reply unless i'm being whispered to. would still be happy to talk with you though

and... yeah, that's about it. will update when i need to
